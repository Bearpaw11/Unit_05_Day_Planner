# Unit_5_Day_Planner
This is a day planner app that I created using Javascript, Jquery, CSS and HTML.
I used Moment.JS to grab the current time and current day.
The app is built dynamically and the timeblocks will change colors as the actual time of day changes
The text will save into local storage and will stay in text boxes when the page is reloaded.
